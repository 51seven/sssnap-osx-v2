##<a name"general">General</a>
This is a 2nd, simplified version of the OSX sssnap Client.  
In general, sssnap is a tool to take screenshots and share them with the world easily.  

###Production
In the 2nd Version, the production will be MVPish. This means we will focus on the key features and make them work and only then will carry on to more adavnced features instead of working on everything simultaniously and never finishing.  
We will have two development circles:
 
+ **Feature Development**: Implement some (key) features in the product and make them work.  
+ **Improvement Circle**: Improve the implemented features too a statisfying lavel, then start over.
